# README Chad Chavez

## Hello, my name is Chad Chavez, and I'm excited to present to you my "About Me" webpage. I've put in a lot of effort to design and develop this website, which reflects my personal interests, skills, and goals.

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/09964ddb-a3db-41cd-8b68-89d361792f40/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/aboutmechadchavez/deploys)

### The purpose of this project is to introduce myself and showcase my (little) skills in web development. Throughout the development process, I learned how to use HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing and user-friendly website. I tried to focus on incorporating various design elements, such as fonts and colors to enhance the website's aesthetic. I also included some multimedia elements the images and video, to make the webpage more engaging.

### Regarding the color scheme, I chose a blue and white color palette to reflect my preference for simplicity and minimalism (also i love blue)--. The RGB and Hex codes for the primary colors used in this project are as follows:

### colors used in this page
--color-dark-blue: #00293C;
--color-blue: #247BA0;
--color-light-blue: #A2D5F2;
--color-off-white: #F0F3F4;
--color-white: #FFFFFF;
